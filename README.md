## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing the sales performance of a retail store to gain useful insights into product performance,customer behaviour, and regional sales distribution. The analysis was executed using [Excel](Excel) for initial data exploration or research, [SQL](SQL) for structured querying, and [PowerBi](PowerBi) for visualizing the results in an interactive dashboard.

## Objectives
1. #### Sales Analysis:
     - Identify Top-selling Products, revenue by region, and monthly sales trends.
     - Determine the percentage contribution of each region and the top customers by revenue.
2. #### Customer Segmentation:
     - Segment customers by subscription type, region, and revenue contribution.
     - Analyse Subscription duration, identify cancellations, and review active in comparison with canceled subscriptions.
  
## Project Tools Used
   - #### Excel:
       For Data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and calculating key metrics.
   - #### SQL:
       To extract insights from the dataset using structured queries.
   - #### PowerBi:
       For creating a dashboard to present the results in a visual and interactive way.

## Dataset Used
Two Datasets was used for this Project:
1. #### Sales Data:
     which contains details on sales transactions, which includes order dates, products, quantites, unit prices, and regions.
2. #### Customer Data:
     This contains customer demographics and subscription details, such as start and end dates, subscription type, and cancellation status.

## Analysis and Key Findings
1. #### Top-Selling Products:
    The product with the highest total sales was identified, providing insight into which items contibute the most revenue.
2. #### Regional Sales Distribution:
    The analysis showed which regions contibute the most to overall sales, helping the business prioritize market strategies.
3. #### Customer Segmentation:
    A pie chart was used in PowerBi to visualize the distribution of customers across different subscription types(Basic, Premium, Standard), identifying the most popular types among the 
    customer base and I also used a stacked bar chart in showing revenue contributions across regions and subscriptions types, highlighting high-value segments.
 4. ####  Subscription Trends:
     A line Chart was used in tracking the number of new subscriptions each month, helping to identify peak periods and growth trend. I also did analysis of average subscription duration for 
     each subscription type to understand customer longevity, visualized in a bar chart.
5. #### Customer Cancellations:
    A bar chart was used to illustrate which regions had higher cancellation rates, helping target retention efforts by rates. It also explored where and why customers cancel subscriptions.

## Excel Analysis
In Excel, the dataset was first cleaned,and pivot tables were created to summarize total sales by region and product. I also did Basic calculations such as average sales per product and total revenue by region. You can view the Excel analysis [here](/Excel/LITACapstoneDataset2.xlsx).
