## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing the sales performance of a retail store to gain useful insights into product performance,customer behaviour, and regional sales distribution. The analysis was executed using [Excel](Excel) for initial data exploration or research, [SQL](SQL) for structured querying, and [PowerBi](PowerBi) for visualizing the results in an interactive dashboard.

## Objectives
1. #### Sales Analysis:
     - Identify Top-selling Products, revenue by region, and monthly sales trends.
     - Determine the percentage contribution of each region and the top customers by revenue.
2. #### Customer Segmentation:
     - Segment customers by subscription type, region, and revenue contribution.
     - Analyse Subscription duration, identify cancellations, and review active in comparison with canceled subscriptions.
  
## Project Tools Used
   - #### Excel:
       For Data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and calculating key metrics.
   - #### SQL:
       To extract insights from the dataset using structured queries.
   - #### PowerBi:
       For creating a dashboard to present the results in a visual and interactive way.

## Dataset Used
Two Datasets was used for this Project:
1. #### Sales Data:
     which contains details on sales transactions, which includes order dates, products, quantites, unit prices, and regions.
2. #### Customer Data:
     This contains customer demographics and subscription details, such as start and end dates, subscription type, and cancellation status.
